Virtual Host -- > this directive defines other directives or configurations which the server uses to serve the requests.
ServerAdmin--> it is useful when an error occurs. It is basically an error message which provide the admin email address e.g., contact@ xxxxx@gmail.com
ServerName--> It is used to identify a virtual host. It sets the hostname. If no serverName is specified the server asks for the hostname from the operating system
ServerAlias--> It just sets alternate names for the hosts. It goes in order of definining alternate names in the configuration to check whether the name matches with the vhost.
PerlModule--> It simply loads the Perl Modules using the package name
PerlSerVar--> It passes the configuration from defined location to the Perl modules using variable  "FormFillerParamFile"
ProxyPass--> This directives maps the actual server to the apache reverse proxy server.
e.g., If i have  Apache RPS-   and actual server -- http://facebook.com/ 
I want to go to login page (/login). so i won't directly jump on to actual server with http://facebook.com/login . ProxyPass will write the request Url as .
ProxyPassReverse--> Before apache send the response to the browser, ProxyPassReverse changes/modifies the header that is received to apache from the server so that it won't redirect it to the other location. Same configuration as ProxyPass. 
SSLEngine --> this directive when set to ON enables SSL connection for communication between client and server. 
SSLProxyEngine-> this directive when enabled provides usage of SSL engine for proxy usage
SSLCertificateFile -->  this point to the crt file which is PEM encoded. It is an encrypted file.
SSLCertificateKeyFile --> it takes the location of the private key file of that server. There also must be a crt file that matches key file. we can combile both crt and key file. although this way is not encouraged. eg.,server.key
